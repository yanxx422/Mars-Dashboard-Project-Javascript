# Functional Programming with Javascript 


### Big Picture

This is Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. 

### How to run

For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, :

```yarn install``` 

and use ```yarn start``` to run the program, the resultant page is shown on ```http:localhost:3000```.
